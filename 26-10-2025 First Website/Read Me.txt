Steps take to create the First Website.
1) Open cmd using the folder where you want to create the virtual envirnment python -m venv vnev (to create virtual envirnment)
2) vnev\Scripts\activate.bat (to activate the virtual envirnment)
3) pip install Flask (to install the Flask) (Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for building web applications in Python. It is commonly used for creating both simple and complex web projects, ranging from REST APIs to full-featured dynamic websites.)
4) Create index.html
5) Create server.py in the system(in you laptop) 
    use the below code from which is a mini example from the website: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/quickstart/#a-minimal-application

        from flask import Flask

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route("/")
        def hello_world():
        return "Hello, Dhruba and Moumita!"
6) Then use the below code in cmd in window

    set FLASK_APP=server.py
    flask run

If any error is showing then check if the flask is showing
    pip show flask
If not found then install it again
    pip install flask
    
    set FLASK_APP=server.py
    flask run

==> set FLASK_APP=server.py
-> This sets the FLASK_APP environment variable to server.py for your current command prompt session.
-> Flask uses the FLASK_APP variable to know which Python file contains your Flask application instance (app = Flask(__name__)).

==> flask run
-> This runs the Flask development server, using the app defined in server.py.
-> By default, Flask serves your app at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

7) Debug mode: No to do this we need to use to below code
        set FLASK_DEBUG=1
        set FLASK_APP=server.py
        flask run
    Debug mode is activated: Flask will automatically reload the server if you make changes to your code.

        * Debug mode: on
        * Debugger is active!
        * Restarting with stat
8) Server is now created now in server.py we need to create url which can access the page
