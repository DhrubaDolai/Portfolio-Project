Mastering Data Retrieval and Integration

Step1: 
Getting the API Key
For getting it I am taking it from the website: https://openweathermap.org/
From under my username>My API KEY

https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

Below it the API key from the websiteS
Example: dagagagavrj188884846aagga681 

# Note don't share this with any one this is dangerous

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}

    Step2: Creating the Weather app using Django
        a) Create a virtual envirnment open the cmd and typing python -m venv vnev
        b) Activate the virtual envirnment typing the command vnev\Scripts\activate.bat
        c) Then install Django by typing the command pip install Django
        d) After installing Django run the command django-admin startproject core .
        e) Then type code . to open visual code
        f) Then python manage.py startapp weather
        g) After that type 'weather', in the settings.py in the INSTALLED_APPS = [] in the core file which we created using the command django-admin startproject core . this will install the newly created app.
        h) After this in the cmd type python manage.py runserver (this will run the server)
        g) Go the the weather file which you created and create a .py file for urls and put the below code
            from django.urls import path
            from .views import index

            urlpatterns = [
            path('', index, name='index'),
            ]

    (adding the app name in INSTALLED_APPS activates the app within your Django project, making its resources and code part of the overall application. Also, it create a path to open our project over here in the core project)
        h) Then got the core>urls.py then add path('', include('weather.urls')),

        Like below:
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.urls import path, include

        urlpatterns = [
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
            path('', include('weather.urls')),
        ]
        Here weather is the name of the application and urls is the project folder.

        i) Now we need to create a index view to create the web site in the front end
            from django.shortcuts import render

            # Create your views here.

            def index(request):
            return render(request, 'weather/index.html')

        j) To check what is you are getting out of the API use the breakpoint() after getting data using the follow code response = requests.get(url)
        data = response.json()
        data
        This will save the data from the api you can see the data in the cmd for further the analysis
